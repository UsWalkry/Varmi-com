# Project Summary
The project, titled "Var mı?", is a reverse marketplace platform that connects buyers and sellers by enabling buyers to post their needs while sellers respond with offers. It features a secure escrow payment system to facilitate transactions and enhance user communication, primarily targeting the Turkish market with multi-language support. Recent updates have introduced a "Favorites" feature, improved dashboard navigation, enhanced error handling, and resolved critical React infinite loop errors, significantly improving the overall user experience.
